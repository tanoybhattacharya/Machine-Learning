As a global specialist in personal insurance, BNP Paribas Cardif serves 90 million clients in 36 countries across Europe, 
Asia and Latin America.

In a world shaped by the emergence of new uses and lifestyles, everything is going faster and faster. When facing unexpected events, 
customers expect their insurer to support them as soon as possible. However, claims management may require different levels of check 
before a claim can be approved and a payment can be made. With the new practices and behaviors generated by the digital economy, 
this process needs adaptation thanks to data science to meet the new needs and expectations of customers.

Kagglers are challenged to predict the probability of a claim based on features available early in the process, helping BNP Paribas 
Cardif accelerate its claims process and therefore provide a better service to its customers.
